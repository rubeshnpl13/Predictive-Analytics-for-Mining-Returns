# 🔗⛏️ Predictive Analytics for Blockchain Mining Rewards using AI

This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence** can be combined with **Blockchain data** to analyze and predict future block mining rewards. By leveraging Ethereum blockchain data and applying machine learning models (like Random Forest), we show the power of predictive modeling in decentralized systems.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 🔍 Collects block reward and timestamp data from the Ethereum blockchain using the Etherscan API.
- 🧠 Trains a predictive machine learning model using Python (RandomForestRegressor).
- 📊 Exports real-world blockchain data to CSV and visualizes predictions using `matplotlib`.
- 🔐 Highlights how AI can enhance transparency and efficiency in blockchain-based ecosystems.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Demonstrate practical integration of **AI + Blockchain**
- Explore predictive capabilities on Ethereum mining rewards
- Promote **data privacy**, **transparency**, and **decentralization** using public blockchain data

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `server.js` — Node.js script to fetch block data and export to CSV
- `block_data.csv` — Raw dataset with timestamp and block reward
- `predict.ipynb` — Python notebook for training the AI model and visualizing predictions

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js + Axios** — Blockchain data collection from Etherscan
- **Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib)** — Data analysis and model building
- **Etherscan API** — Public Ethereum blockchain data
- **Random Forest** — Regression model for reward prediction

---

## 🔐 Why Blockchain + AI?

- **Transparency**: Use verifiable public data for AI modeling
- **Data Privacy**: Avoid centralized data silos by training on decentralized public data
- **Innovation**: Bridge cutting-edge AI with decentralized infrastructure
